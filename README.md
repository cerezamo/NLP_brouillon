# Are french men and women speaking the same language ? - NLP project ENSAE 2020 

## Get started with the code

1. First you should open the notebook, we recommand to use Google Colab : "NLP_poject_MHMP.ipynb"

2. Drag all files that are in the document "to_put_in_colab" in your environment. 

**Be carefull** 

Computation is **extremely slow** (about 4 hours only to compute the first part) for the big dataset of 5000 speeches. In order for the reader to be able to test this code we propose two options : 
* Use the "minimal" dataset containing only 500 speeches. Just search in the notebook for "minimal" and you will find all cells were you should change dataset.
* Use directly the calculated features in the "medium_df_var.csv"
