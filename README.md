# Are french men and women speaking the same language ? - NLP project ENSAE 2020 

## Get started with the code

1. First you should open the notebook, we recommand to use Google Colab : "NLP_poject_MHMP.ipynb"

2. Drag all files that are in the document "to_put_in_colab" in your environment. 

**Be carefull** 

In order to test the code we recommand you to use only the "minimal" dataset containing only 500 speeches. Computation is **extremely slow** (about 4 hours only to compute the first part) for the big dataset of 5000 speeches. Just search in the notebook for "minimal" and you will find all cells were you should change dataset.
